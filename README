Intended as a locally hosted (or restricted access) django site for tracking deposit policies of academic journals. Allows for "Publisher wide" and "Journal specific" via either publically accessible or Institutional granted permissions for full-text deposit. This project arose out of a need for checking of internally verified copyright policies and tracking of special permissions granted to a repository by publishers.
