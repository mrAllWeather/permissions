permissions
===========

localised database for tracking deposit policies of academic journals. Allows for "Publisher wide", "Journal specific" and "Institutional granted" permissions for full-text deposit. This project arose out of a need for checking of internally verified copyright policies and tracking of special permissions granted to a repository by publishers.
